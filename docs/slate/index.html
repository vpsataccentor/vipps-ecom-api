      description: &gt;-
        This API call allows the merchants to initiate a payment flow by using
        Vipps. In order to identify which sales channel payments are coming
        from, a merchantSerialNumber is used to distinguish between them. Please
        note that a single payment is uniquely identified by a composite of merchantSerialNumber and orderId. The
        Merchant provided orderId must be unique per sales channel. Once the
        transaction is successfully initiated in Vipps, you will receive a
        URL in response which will direct the customer to the landing page. The landing page will have functionality to
        identify and differentiate request coming from mobile browser/desktop
        browser. The merchant may also pass the &#39;isApp&#39; parameter that will make Vipps respond with a app-switch deeplink that will take the customer directly to the Vipps app. URLs passed to Vipps should be URL-encoded, and must validate
        with the Apache Commons

                  description: &gt;-
                    This API endpoint on the merchant side allows Vipps to get the shipping
                    cost and method based on the provided address and product details. The
                    primary use of this service is Vipps Hurtigkasse (express checkout)
                    where Vipps needs to present shipping cost and method to the Vipps user.
                    Vipps will add <code>/v2/payments/{orderId}/shippingDetails</code> to the end of
                    this URL.
                    Vipps has a <em>10 second timeout</em> for these requests, and thus requires
                    a quick reply from the merchant&#39;s server for successful payments.
                    URLs passed to Vipps should be URL-encoded, and must validate
                    with the Apache Commons
                    <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-validator/apidocs/org/apache/commons/validator/routines/UrlValidator.html">UrlValidator</a>.
                    We don&#39;t send requests to all ports, so to be safe use common ports such as: 80, 443, 8080.

        Transaction text is not optional and is used as a proof of delivery
        (tracking code, consignment number etc.). In a case of direct capture,
        both fund reservation and capture are executed in a single operation.
